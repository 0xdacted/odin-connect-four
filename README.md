# odin-connect-four

A simple Connect Four game built in Ruby with a TDD approach. This is my second TDD project but the first that was initially built through TDD rather than refactored.

Making these projects has gotten much easier as I have progressed as a programmer. I feel that in the course of this project, I implemented much of what I have learned over the past (almost) two months of my self-taught programming journey.
